# Question

Take a look at the demo of the app that you must build in the coding portion. Describe a potential component hierarchy for this application using a bulleted list. Demonstrate parent-child component relationships using indented bullets.

See below where we've given you a template to start working with

- App
  - component1
    - child1
    - child2
  - component2
    - child1
    - child2
      - grandchild1

# Answer

In the given application, upon clicking a button, the component text changes by becoming translated into the buttons language. In addition, clicking the addition and subtraction buttons atop the text trigger the text to either grow in size or decrease in size, respectively.

A potential component hierarchy for this application is as follows:

- App
  - Main Page
    - TranslateText Component
      - Text
    - ChangeSize Component
      - Text

In this hierarchy, an app has a main page component rendering the full view of the text and the button components. In addition, the button components both take in the text component. To rationalize, the reason why I believe they'd be two separate components is because there doesn't need to be a set order in which a user has to invoke either size or translation buttons.
