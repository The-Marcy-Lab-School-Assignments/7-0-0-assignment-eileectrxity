# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer
The return value of the `useState` hook in React is an array data typ. The `useState` hook is used to represent a dynamic variable whose `state` changes throughout the application. Below is an example of how it's used:

```js
[currState, setState] = useState([]); //destructuring where the first arr el is the mutable, changing var state and the second is how we can reassign the current state
```

By default, `useState` returns whatever is inside its array as the initial value.
