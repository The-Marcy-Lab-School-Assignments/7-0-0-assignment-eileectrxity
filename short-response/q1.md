# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer
React is a JavaScript framework that uses Javascript to manipulate a sort of virtual DOM. It allows us to use JavaScript to make dynamic changes to static HTML files in a way that does not require the DOM to reparse and refresh after every change. Instead, the changes are done in memory making the website run faster and smoother.
